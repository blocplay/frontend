/**
 * This class receives a class name that will be set on the entering and leaving screen (route), but
 * will also add '--entering' when it is the "higher" screen that is entering, and "--leaving" when
 * it is the "lower" screen that is entering (so the "higher" is leaving).
 *
 * A screen (or route) is considered "higher" than another one when it is defined after the other in
 * the `children` array of a route Group.
 *
 * This Animation object is used when we want a different animation when going to or when coming
 * from a "higher" screen.
 *
 * For example, we have a `Group` with the following (simplified) children: `['/dashboard',
 * '/login']. Here, `/login` is "higher" since it is defined after. We set the animation of this
 * group to `new OrderBased('my-anim')`.
 *
 * When going from `/dashboard` to `/login`, the higher screen is _entering_. We will then have the
 * following (simplified) structure:
 * 		<div class="screenAnimation__my-anim--entering">
 * 			   <div class="screenAnimation-leave">[content of /dashboard]</div>
 * 			   <div class="screenAnimation-enter">[content of /login]</div>
 * 		</div>
 * That way, we know that the `screenAnimation-leave` element is the "lower" since the parent class
 * ends with `--entering`. Here, "--entering" or "--leaving" always represent the point of view of
 * the "higher" screen. If we were going from `/dashboard` to `/login`, the outer element's class
 * would be `screenAnimation__my-anim--leaving`
