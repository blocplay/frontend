	 * first removes the `screenAnimation-X` class name, and then removes the element from the DOM.
	 * So we might have a 'flash' when the class defining the z-index was removed and when the
	 * element was removed.
	 *
	 * This method is called when the screen is animating (leaving or entering). It gets the z-index
	 * and sets it as a style prop, so when the class name is removed, the z-index is still applied.
